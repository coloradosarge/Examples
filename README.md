# Example Code Explanations
This Repo contains a sample of code examples from a variety of projects.  Note that this is only a small sample of all the projects I've been involved in.  Most of the more complicated projects are proprietary property of the government, educational institution, or businesses for which the project was commissioned.

##CSAT Scripts
This is a collection of scripts that were written in VBS to quickly check the security posture of a standalone system.  Checks written include registry values, file permissions, file extistence, firewall rules, user rights, etc.  At the time these scripts were written they were revolutionary.  Unfortunately, they are crude and not fully developed as these were developed as an interim tool while DISA developed SCAP and OVAL engines that had much better functionality.

##DNSOmatic Utility
This is a single script that I've been using on my home network to allow the use Dymanic DNS services such as Cisco's OpenDNS services and DynDNS hostnames.  I do this to serve services such as Email, VoIP, web, and media services from my home network.

##GeoIP Tool
This is a quick tool to take a location and provide a coordinate and address. 

##KringleCon 2019
These are parts of solutions I developed for the KringleCon 2019 CTF, of which I successfully solved every single challenge over the course of about 3-4 days.  The two solutions provided include a solution of the algorithm used to break the encryption challenge and the python script used to leverage the TensorFlow libraries to bypass a CAPTCHA.

##MDI Macros
This is a Macro I wrote for a local organization in Omaha.  The organization uses an Excel spreadsheet to manage inventory.  This macro takes a number of different spreadsheets and merges them into one single spreadsheet containing all the relevant information.  As a side note, I recommended a different approach via a web-based application but the owner did not feel comfortable using anything but Excel.

##Mangelsens Marketing
This PowerShell script is used to integrate another client's point-of-sale database with MailChimp to sent out targeted marketing email.

##OSSEC/Elastic Stack Integration
This was a personal project of integrating the Elatic Stack platform with OSSEC.  I had to write all of my own Grok rules as there were not sets of rules that did what I wanted them to do (i.e. fine grained analytics, charting, and reporting or OSSEC events) 

##UoM Crytography
These are portions of the solutions I wrote in Python for a University of Maryland Cryptography course taken through Coursea.  I have taken the Stanford Coursera Crytpography course as well but the solutions I wrote for that course were wiped out when the company laptop's hard drive failed.
